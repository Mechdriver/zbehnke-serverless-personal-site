              I was raised around computers. My dad was a programmer and would constantly work and play with them throughout my childhood.
              My early experiences with computers involved video games. I loved point and click adventure games and whatever retro games my dad could emulate on his machines.

              I knew what programming was thanks to the Foxtrot and Dilbert comics that I would read obsessively. I really wanted
              to learn C++ but I could not find the proper resources to teach myself. Even though I was motivated to learn, I found programming textbooks daunting.

              As I was applying to colleges I knew that I wanted to work with computers. I wanted to program them. I applied early to Cal Poly SLO for Software Engineering.
              After a few months of anticipation I was accepted.

              Before I left for college I decided to teach myself some programming. I discovered Python and attempted to write a small text based adventure game.
              Python is still one of my favorite languages and it is my top choice for projects and scripts.

              With time, work, and internships I became more and more adept at programming. My classes gave me exposure to OpenGL, Android, and a variety of languages.
              One of my internships introduced me to embedded systems. My part time job during my Senior year introduced me to industry level software development.

              After I graduated from Cal Poly I received a job offer for a company in the Bay Area. I am currently working there as a web developer.
              My weekends are spent hiking with my girlfriend, breeding Pok√©mon, and tinkering with interesting JavaScript frameworks.
