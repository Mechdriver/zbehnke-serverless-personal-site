              I was raised around computers. My dad was a programmer and would constantly work and play with them throughout my childhood.
              My early experiences with computers involved video games. I loved point and click adventure games and whatever retro games my dad could emulate on his machines.

              I knew what programming was thanks to the Foxtrot and Dilbert comics that I would read obsessively. I really wanted
              to learn C++ but I could not find the proper resources to teach myself. Even though I was motivated to learn, I found programming textbooks daunting.

              As I was applying to colleges I knew that I wanted to work with computers. I wanted to program them. I applied early to Cal Poly SLO for Software Engineering.
              After a few months of anticipation I was accepted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I left for college I decided to teach myself some programming basics. I discovered Python and attempted to write a small text based adventure game.
              Python is still one of my favorite languages and it is my top choice for projects and scripts.

              With time, work, and internships I became more and more adept at programming. My classes gave me exposure to OpenGL, Android, and a variety of languages.
              One of my internships introduced me to embedded systems. My part time job during my Senior year introduced me to industry level software development.
            </p>
            <p>
              After I graduated from Cal Poly I received a job offer for Course Hero where I learned the intricacies of web development.
              I made a lot of friends there but eventually found myself to be the only one of my friend group left.
            <p>
              I currently work at Nextdoor doing web development with Django and React. I have also picked up iOS development skills while on the job!
              Right now I am having amazing experiences working with my team and more and more people are using the features that we work on every day.
            </p>
              Because of Covid-19, my evenings and weekends are spent playing videogames with friends, doing home workouts, and having video chats with my fianc√©e.
